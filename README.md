# Scheduler

## Description

- This project was designed to be a functional scheduler application, enabling users to create and save events.
The primary objective was to develop JavaScript code that effectively supports event scheduling and data persistence.
This scheduler solves the challenge of building a reliable scheduling tool with the capability to retain user-inputted events.
In the process of creating this application, I learned how to use'localStorage.setItem' and 'localStorage.getItem'.
